    THE ODIN PROJECT
    
    
    This project was completed by Gustavo Chiele on The Odin Project
    It was made in about 8 hours with an item by item approach.
    I honestly don't know if it is the right way to do it, but it looks
    exactly like it's suppose to look, so I'm going to consider this a WIN!
